# Basic facts
While using the robotframework for creating the test framework for selenium. have faced with thhe error that chormedriver is missing. After installing the chromedriver, 
there were other errors , which were mostly packages missing. With all packages in place, still the basic test case of opening a browser and closing the same did not 
work as expected.
